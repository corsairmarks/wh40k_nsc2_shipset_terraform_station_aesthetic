# Overview

Do you like terraform stations from my mod [Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084)?  Do you also want to have properly-skinned terraform stations for [We are the Imperial Navy NSC2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2079926133)?  Then this mod is for you!

# Changes

Adds a terraform station definition with an active terraforming beam for graphical culture `gothic_01`, required for Aesthetic Terraform Stations to apply the correct appearance.

## Compatibility

Should work with practically everything that also works with We are the Imperial Navy NSC2 and Aesthetic Terraform Stations. Also works with Unofficial fix WH40K Imperial Navy Shipset NSC2.

Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor."  Not compatible with achievements, but neither are the dependencies.

### Required Dependency Mods

* [Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084) enables the very old-school terraform stations as visual markers for terraforming planets
* One of the following shipsets:
    * [We are the Imperial Navy NSC2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2079926133) for the graphics and other ship-related code
    * [Unofficial fix WH40K Imperial Navy Shipset NSC2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937845657) for the graphics and other ship-related code

## Changelog

* 1.0.0 Initial version
* 1.0.1 Fix compatibility trigger name
* 1.0.2 Rename files to avoid a conflict with the non-NSC2 add-on
* 1.0.3 Fix the name of a dependency in the .mod file

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
