# Overview

Do you like terraform stations from my mod [Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084)?  Do you also want to have properly-skinned terraform stations for the [Expanded Gestalts: Forgotten Queens](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715190550)?  Then this mod is for you!

# Changes

TODO: messages about all the crisis shipsets, willing to add other crisis shipset mods - leave comments!

Adds a terraform station definition with an active terraforming beam for graphical culture `complex_ship_gc`, required for Aesthetic Terraform Stations to apply the correct appearance.

## Compatibility

Should work with practically everything that also works with Aesthetic Terraform Stations.

Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor."  Not compatible with achievements, but neither ia the dependency.

### Required Dependency Mods

* [Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084) enables the very old-school terraform stations as visual markers for terraforming planets

### Recommended Companion Mods

* [Expanded Gestalts: Forgotten Queens](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715190550) adds a shipset built using the Prethoryn models

## Changelog

* 1.0.0 Initial version

## Source Code

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
